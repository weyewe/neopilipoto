  <strong>Hello!!</strong> When you are done with selecting the pictures, please <strong>click the 
   "I am DONE" button</strong>
  to tell the owner that you are done. <br />Then, we can start the finalizing these selected pictures! (yeah, we will do some <strong>editing magic</strong> to make it awesome for you).
